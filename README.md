###Introduction
Quoting the musical poet Bob Dylan- “For the times they are a-changin'”.  The HHS community we jointly serve is becoming more millennial-focused every day, expecting intuitive, accessible, and integrated solutions to deliver social service programs and benefits. States are also transitioning to new open technologies, integrated data, and nimble development processes to yield meaningful outcomes in a timely manner. CGI can guide the State across the changing landscape, with 5+ years deploying enterprise applications using Agile methodologies across diverse technology ecosystems, including the extended HHS community in 34 states, and the Federal Government (including CMS). Attachment A  contains additional information our extensive project history.  
The CGI Sacramento office is very pleased to submit the CA->CareMail POC under Solicitation RFI-75001. 

###Process
CGI organized our Scrum-based Agile effort around weekly Sprints to advance the 
CA->CareMail POC from a blank slate to a shippable MVP in about three weeks. Real-time communication kept the team focused and minimized missteps.
