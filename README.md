###Introduction
Quoting the musical poet Bob Dylan- “For the times they are a-changin'”.  The HHS community we jointly serve is becoming more millennial-focused every day, expecting intuitive, accessible, and integrated solutions to deliver social service programs and benefits. States are also transitioning to new open technologies, integrated data, and nimble development processes to yield meaningful outcomes in a timely manner. CGI can guide the State across the changing landscape, with 5+ years deploying enterprise applications using Agile methodologies across diverse technology ecosystems, including the extended HHS community in 34 states, and the Federal Government (including CMS). Attachment A contains additional information on our  project history.  

The CGI Sacramento office is very pleased to submit the CA->CareMail POC under Solicitation RFI-75001. 

###Process
CGI organized our Scrum-based Agile effort around weekly Sprints to advance the 
CA->CareMail POC from a blank slate to a shippable MVP in about three weeks. Real-time communication kept the team focused and minimized missteps.

Initial tasks focused on decomposing the early vision of our Product Manager through stakeholder engagement and user experience modeling. 

This resulted in an initial set of personas and user stories being loaded into the Product Backlog. Design and ideation sessions continued during all Sprints to focus and evolve the POC. 

When the magic started, the team worked together through weekly Sprints. Sprint planning confirmed the scope and set of tasks the team would engage in next week. Development team members worked from the agreed Sprint scope to define the “how” aspects of the technical solution and produce working code.

Daily team Scrum meetings reviewed Sprint progress, identified dependences and flagged any blockers.  Both our Delivery Manager and Agile Coach worked to resolve blockers.

Twice weekly, product demos gave all team members visibility into the maturing CA->CareMail POC. Stakeholder feedback at the demos provided a dynamic circuit for course correction.

After each sprint was completed, the team took time to perform a retrospective. This continuous improvement activity identified useful process improvements for future Sprints.  

Major events in the CA->CareMail POC timeline visually unfolded as seen in Figure 2:

###POC Backlog
Our product pipeline identified the core Child Welfare functionality needed by the CA->CareMail POC. We acknowledged that the actual detail of Child Welfare service processes extend far beyond the scope of this engagement. Figure 3 visually represents the key services developed in the POC vs the scope of material staged for future development. For example, we developed a symbolic shell of a Case Plan as a proxy for future refinement.

The CA->CareMail POC backlog was managed in JIRA and was visible to the team. Following a positive Agile process, features that could not be completed within the POC duration are visible in the JIRA roadmap for the State’s consideration.  The POC product backlog is available as a [resource](CACareMailIndex.MD).

Our digital Sprint board (see Figure 4) shows how the team coordinated daily tasks from To Do, In Progress (coding), through Peer Review, Testing and finally into “Done” status.

###The CGI Team 
A blended team of agile developers, foster care domain stakeholders, and user experience researchers came together collaboratively to develop the CA->CareMail POC. For several team members, the project took on a special meaning since they have significant connections to the Child Welfare community.  The CGI team included members from twelve of the labor categories identified in Attachment C, as shown in Figure 5.

*Figure 5 – The dedicated and experienced CGI POC team*

Our combined team brings over 70+ years of partnership experience with CHHS, 75+ years in foster care support, 35+ years of open-source software technology and 45+ years in agile development. 

###Hearing the User’s Voice
In developing the CA->CareMail user experience, the CGI team leveraged several user-centered design concepts to effectively hear the user’s voice and align the POC accordingly. Personas captured the user’s life context, and user stories defined functional needs. Participatory design brought software designers and user stakeholders together on an equal footing during design sessions.
Our usability testing allowed actual birth parents and case workers to evaluate the UX design proactively, providing key feedback to the development team. Figure 6 shows a sample survey topic collected.

Based on this feedback, changes were made to both the size and weight of the POC text, improving screen readability.

###Technical Direction
Built following best practices from the U.S. Digital Playbook and the U.S. Web Design Standards style guide, our CA->CareMail POC is a feature-complete and capable application that demonstrates our professional Agile development capabilities. We built the POC with an enterprise, N-tiered open architecture that provides a responsive UX web interface via PC, tablet, or mobile device browser.

CGI heard the State’s goals for modern and open technologies, incorporating [seven](artifacts/Technical_Components.pdf) such resources across all tiers on the solution (front, middle, backend). The POC is containerized using a Docker open platform; it leverages the AWS framework, and is currently deployed on the Amazon IaaS. In addition, the team leveraged open source tools to manage the project (JIRA) and communicate across the team (Slack).  Continuous build and automated testing services were established to maximize development velocity and reduce process errors.  Installation on a new host is streamlined by the tools and documentation contained in Docker.

Additional technical artifacts are available in the [repository](CACareMailIndex.MD)

###MVP POC Results 
The resulting CA->CareMail POC is clean and usable, designed to help parents establish and manage their profiles, view local facilities, and communicate securely with their case worker.

###Summary
As client needs and the HHS industry is changing, the CGI Sacramento, California office is also changing to better serve you. We approach every engagement with one objective in mind: to help clients succeed.
